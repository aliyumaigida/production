      <p style="color: white;text-align:center">
        Agriculture is practised by around 70% of the Indian population. As a
        result, crop production and management are critical to ensuring maximum
        productivity in the fields. The following are the key agricultural
        practices involved in crop production and management: Soil Preparation
        and Seed Sowing Manure Fertiliser addition Irrigation Weed Protection
        Harvesting Storage

      <p style="background-color: green;color:white;text-align:center">
        Before the seeds are planted, the earth is loosened and inclined.
        Ploughs are used to do this. If there are large lumps in the soil, they
        are broken up with a hoe. This procedure aerates the soil, allowing the
        roots to breathe freely. Nutrients and minerals are correctly combined
        with the soil and rise to the surface. As a result, the soil becomes
        more fertile and suitable for cultivation

      <p style="text-decoration: none;text-align:center">
        Seeds of high quality and free of the virus are collected and sown on
        prepared land. The seeds should be planted at the right depths and
        intervals. The following are the numerous ways for sowing seeds:

      <p style="text-align: center;">
        The soil may lack the necessary nutrients to support plant growth. As a
        result, manures and fertilisers are put into the soil to improve its
        fertility and assist plants to thrive. In compost pits, plant and animal
        debris decompose to produce manure. Fertilizers, on the other hand, are
        factory-made compounds that contain nutrients for a certain plant. They
        produce quicker outcomes than manures. However, when applied
        extensively, they render the land infertile

      <h2 style="color: white;text-align:center" id="irrig">Irrigation</h2>
      <p style="color: white;text-align:center">
        Crops require water at regular intervals to grow properly. Irrigation is
        the process of supplying water to plants. Rivers, lakes, and tube wells
        are all distinct types of irrigation sources. Humans and animals are
        used in traditional agricultural methods. Moats, chain-pump, dhekli, and
        rahat are some of the old methods. The sprinkler system and the drip
        system are two current irrigation strategies. Water is critical for the
        germination of seeds. It promotes the growth of flowers, fruits, seeds,
        and plants. As a result, it should be present in great numbers in
        plants.

      <h2 style="color: aliceblue;text-align:center" id="harv">Harvesting</h2>
      <p style="color: white; text-align:center">
        When the crop reaches maturity, it is harvested for further processing.
        This is referred to as harvesting. It is usually manual labour performed
        with the aid of a sickle. However, mechanical harvesting is now used â€“
        machines such as combine harvesters are used to harvest and thresh crops
        in one pass. Threshing is the process of separating grains from
        harvested crops. It is either done mechanically or by livestock.
        Winnowing is the process of separating grains from the chaff. It can be
        done mechanically or manually
